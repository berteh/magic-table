				<div class="entry" id="mainContentText">
					
					<p class="text">
					Visualisation is of a holistic nature – it is more than the sum of its parts.  
					It is essentially a cognitive aid that provides inspiration or insight into the 
					previously latent relationships within data.  This is called cognitive amplification [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>].  
					This page begins by describing the field’s roots in scientific visualisation before discussing 
					some of the facets that comprise the visualisation of abstract data.
					</p>
					<br />
					
					<h2>Scientific visualisation</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					In 1987 the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the United States published a report, 
					Visualization in scientific computing [<a href="#MDB87">MDB87</a>] that paved the way for the fields of 
					scientific and information visualisation.  The emphasis on visualisation was (and still is) 
					dominant because the NSF recognised that visualisation provides scientists with a tool that 
					can transform their myriad data into images that allow people to recognise patterns.  It 
					was also realised that when visualising simulations of physical systems, the scientists 
					could steer the simulations by changing the parameters used in their calculations and 
					immediately gain visual feedback, whereas previously the calculations would require to be 
					rerun in entirety.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Scientific visualisation occurs when physical data are represented by graphics portraying 
					a physical system, allowing scientists to explore its properties.  In this way the 
					visualisation is an external aid supporting the human’s mental model of a system; it 
					helps humans perceive its properties and amplifies cognition [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>].  If it were not for 
					apt visualisations then humans could easily fall foul of information overload.  If someone 
					were to look at a database table consisting of thousands of records, each representing an 
					object (datum), and each with numerous variables (columns), it would be almost impossible to 
					gain an overview of structure in the data.  The virtue of visualisation also enhances 
					communication and teaching because much of the information portrayed cannot be easily 
					communicated in print [<a href="#DBM89">DBM89</a>].
					<p>
						
					<p class="text">
					Application areas for scientific visualisation include molecular modelling, medical imaging, 
					meteorology, astrophysics, flow analysis and seismology. (see Figures 1 and 2).  The 
					common property of the data predominant in such fields is that the variables are inherently 
					spatial and can map directly on to a spatial substrate rendered on a screen.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					A typical implementation for scientific visualisation systems is in the form of a modular 
					data-flow architecture where data are piped through a set of modules, each of which has a 
					specific purpose such as carrying out calculations, rendering or controlling parameter values.  
					This piping of data is akin to the familiar UNIX pipe command for controlling the flow of data 
					in inter-process communication [<a href="#Hae88">Hae88</a>].  The data-flow architecture allows the modules to be 
					connected in a network that ultimately shapes the application with respect to its input, 
					transformations and graphical rendering.  This notion has been extended to allow users to 
					explicitly build the data-flow network, usually through direct manipulation of representations 
					of the modules at the interface, and effectively build their own applications [<a href="#AT95a">AT95a</a>, <a href="#Bas00">BBB*93</a>, 
					<a href="#Hae88">Hae88</a>, <a href="#UFK*89">UFK*89</a>].

					<h2>Information visualisation</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					According to Card, Mackinlay and Shneiderman, the phrase Information Visualisation was first 
					adopted in [<a href="#RCM89">RCM89</a>]. In this context information refers to non-physically based abstract data 
					and visualisation is the use of computers to visually render these data in such a way that humans 
					can interactively explore their structure.  Information visualisation is inspired by scientific 
					visualisation but in this case the data to be turned into information are abstract and generally 
					have no straightforward physical derivation. Figure 3 provides an example in which the abstract 
					data, in this case search results returned by Google, can be interactively and pictorially 
					summarised according to criteria such as hit rank and web-page size. 
					</p>

					<p class="figureCaption">
					Figure 3  A Honeycomb© [<a href="#Hon04">Hon04</a>] view of results returned by the Google internet search engine. 
					The visualisation is based upon Johnson and Shneiderman’s treemap [<a href="#JS91">JS91</a>]: a technique designed 
					to utilize space efficiently in the display of hierarchical information structures.
					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Information visualisations are holistic and have many facets such as interaction mechanisms, 
					spatial representations and abstraction. The fields of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), 
					cognitive, Gestalt and ecological psychology influence them.  The types of data and their 
					volume in terms of data set size and dimensionality are key issues in determining their form, 
					and therefore mathematical algorithms play a major part in both data transformations and 
					visual rendering.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Applications of information visualisation include stock market analysis, project management, 
					risk analysis, information retrieval etc. The literature presents many information visualisation 
					techniques and workspaces borne of diverse architectures.  Some examples are Visage [<a href="#RCK*97">RCK*97</a>], 
					IVEE [<a href="#AW95">AW95</a>], Information Visualizer [<a href="#CRM91">CRM91</a>] and snap-together visualisation [<a href="#NS00a">NS00a</a>, <a href="#NS00b">NS00b</a>, 
					<a href="#Nor01">Nor01</a>, <a href="#NS01">NS01</a>]. Figure 4 shows an application of visualisation in project management. This tool 
					is part of a commercial issues-tracking package [<a href="#Nic04">Nic04</a>] developed by the author for Nickleby HFE 
					Ltd. In this case, the author has used the package to track issues relevant to his PhD research. 
					The visualisation shown here is of a subset of the issues, arranged according to how they are 
					interrelated.

					<br><br><br>
					
					<h2>Abstraction</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Abstraction is a conceptual representation of a physical (or non-physical) object.  In computer 
					graphics this abstraction is the visual rendering of properties of the object.  This presents less 
					of a problem in scientific visualisation because the properties tend to be physical.  However, in 
					information visualisation, the properties of objects tend to have no straightforward derivation from 
					physical space and thus the problem of creating visual representations that appeal to the human’s 
					perception is harder.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					There are four prominent considerations in the process of creating visual representations of abstract 
					data.  These are dimensionality, which will be discussed in more detail in the next section, data 
					types, Gestalt principles and visual structures.  Each of these must be taken into account in order 
					to provide an effective mapping of data onto a perceptual visual form, namely a 2- or 3- dimensional 
					spatial substrate.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Gestalt principles</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Humans can interpret visual information very quickly.  When we look at a picture, whether static or 
					animated, our visual system allows us to perceive patterns and relationships between components of the 
					picture.  For example, a group of points on a scatterplot, which are close together, will be perceived 
					to be a cluster and therefore stand out as one perceptual unit.  This is illustrated in Figure 5.  
					It is with regard to such automatic pattern or grouping detection that Gestalt principles exist.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Gestalt is the German translation of the word shape or form and is the inspiration for the Gestalt 
					school of psychology that, in the early part of the 20th century, investigated some perceptual grouping 
					properties and devised the Gestalt laws of grouping [<a href="#Rom01">Rom01</a>]. The table, below, provides a categorisation of these 
					laws [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>].

					<p class="text">
					The discovery of these principles means that they can be exploited to produce visualisations where 
					the human can perceive aggregate structures or patterns to form a visual indexing.  This means 
					that individual objects within a depiction become easier to find and thus in a good visualisation, 
					exhaustive searching is not required.  For example, the spring model [<a href="#Ead84">Ead84</a>] was proposed to produce 
					aesthetically pleasing graph layouts but has been widely used to produce layouts of general data objects. 
					This meant that clusters could be formed and thus aid in analysing the intrinsic relationships within 
					data [<a href="#Cha96">Cha96</a>].

					Figure 5:  A scatterplot has the potential to make groups of points appear as individual perceptual 
					units (clusters). For example, the author would assume that in making reference to ‘A’ in the figure, 
					the reader’s attention would be drawn to the upper cluster as a whole and not the single point nearest 
					to the label.

					<p class="text">
					Also, in [<a href="#WAM01">WAM01</a>] time series data are mapped onto a spiral in order to make better use of screen real 
					estate and to aid in the detection of cycles. This can be considered as an example of the good 
					continuation rule and is illustrated in Figure 6.  However, it should be noted that the groups 
					formed within a visual representation are only useful if they reflect actual relations within the 
					data and are not a side-effect of the underlying rendering process.

					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					The Gestalt principles of organisation indicate that in a good layout, abstract data can be organised 
					to provide a visualisation that reveals information in the structure and relationships within the data.  
					As a final example on the importance of the Gestalt principles, consider the following figure:

					<p class="figureCaption">

					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					The above figure illustrates that at the heart of Gestalt theory is the proposition that in perception 
					the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Visual structures</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					The mapping of data as abstract objects to symbols within a space is closely related to the Gestalt 
					principles, specifically the similarity rule described above. However, there is more to visualisation 
					than merely grouping similar objects.  In the case of using visualisations for analysis and problem 
					solving, individual entities may require comparison.  For example, in a frequency domain graph, at 
					what frequencies are the highest magnitudes exhibited?  This brings to bear the need to distinguish 
					between the types of variable considered and the spatial substrate in which they are represented. 
					The main categories for variable types are as follows:

					Table 2: Variable types.
					</p>
					
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					In [<a href="#CM97">CM97</a>], a list of graphical properties is described and the appropriate mapping of variable types to some 
					of these is demonstrated.  The graphical properties are marks (including points, lines, areas, surfaces and 
					volumes), position in space, and retinal properties, including shape, size, orientation etc.  It has been 
					established that certain variable types are better mapped onto specific graphical properties than others, 
					i.e. some properties are more effective encoders of information than others.  For example, in [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>] it 
					is stated that greyscale is better for encoding and comparing nominal variables than quantitative variables.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					The careful use of graphical properties is essential in creating a visualisation that communicates 
					information to the user.  There have been a number of models proposed which aim to classify data by 
					the type of visualisation that could best convey information.  Several of these are described in [<a href="#Rob99">Rob99</a>] 
					where an algebraic method is proposed to describe visualisations in order to guide the visual designer in 
					creating the most effective depiction of abstract data.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Data types</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Where the type of variables considered in a visualisation can suggest the most appropriate representative 
					glyphs and symbols, the overall intrinsic structure of data (internal relationships and dimensionality) can 
					suggest the utilisation of pre-existing visualisation types.  As an example, temporal data may lend itself 
					to being presented as a Gantt chart.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					In [<a href="#Shn96">Shn96</a>], Shneiderman describes a Task by Data Type Taxonomy whereby a designer can choose between given 
					examples of visualisations depending upon the type of data to be processed.  The seven data types Shneiderman 
					outlines are:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>1-dimensional</li>
						<li>2-dimensional</li>
						<li>3-dimensional</li>
						<li>multi-dimensional</li>
						<li>temporal</li>
						<li>tree</li>
						<li>network</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<p class="text">
					This taxonomy was devised with Shneiderman’s Visual Information seeking mantra 
					[<a href="#Shn96">Shn96</a>] in mind: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.”  Shneiderman suggested 
					that each component of the mantra is one of the salient tasks in visual information seeking.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					The major point of this section is to show that when a data type is known, there may already be 
					tried and tested techniques for presenting a visualisation and therefore provide a basis for discussion 
					or prevent the designer from ‘re-inventing the wheel’ for new tools.
					</p>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<h2>Dimensionality</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Dimensionality pertains to the number of attributes or variables that are to be considered for every object 
					within a visualisation.  For example, a geographical position can be described by two variables: latitude 
					and longitude. Dimensionality is an important consideration in information visualisation because humans 
					can only readily perceive structures within a low number of dimensions.  If a set of objects of three 
					dimensions or less is to be visualised, then the dimensions can be mapped directly onto a set of orthogonal 
					axes. Considering the example above, a set of geographical positions may be displayed by mapping longitude 
					to the x-axis and latitude to the y-axis, while maintaining the proportional distance interrelationships 
					between points.  However, there are many cases where the entities to be visualised have many dimensions and 
					therefore there is no direct mapping to a 2- or 3-dimensional substrate.  As an example, consider the 
					visualisation of a corpus of textual documents where each unique word contained within the set is regarded 
					as a dimension.  In this case the dimensionality of the space in which the objects reside can go into the 
					tens of thousands.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					In this section some of the techniques that have been applied to the visualisation of low (≤3) 
					and high (>3) dimensional data will be discussed.
					</p>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<h3>1-dimensional visualisation</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					A common example of 1-dimensional data is a list.  Lists may be composed of any variable types, but in this 
					section strings represented as ordinals will be considered.  In [<a href="#Eic94a">Eic94a</a>] a visualisation tool called SeeSoft 
					is presented where lines of source code are greatly visually compressed into narrow rectangles along a 
					folding axis (see Figure 8).  The author of [<a href="#Eic94a">Eic94a</a>] describes this method as reduced representation and 
					claims that up to 50,000 lines of code can be displayed within one screen.  The beauty of this approach is 
					that the reduced representation holds all of the spatial pattern information within the data set in the 
					same way as the original text, but reduced in size so that an overview is gained that maintains recognisable 
					groupings of the unreduced text.  The system also offers interactive features such as a magic lens to allow 
					users to magnify and read sections of code.  The retinal variable, colour, is also used to map statistical 
					information such as modification requests to lines of code.  In this way, the user can scan the overview of 
					the code and automatically process the colour information to detect patterns and areas of interest for deeper 
					examination.  It may be argued that one of the contributors to the effectiveness of this visualisation is the 
					familiarity rule of the Gestalt principles.  The reduced representation of the source code does not distort 
					the proportional natural layout of the data and therefore sections (groups) of lines may remain recognisable. 
					The SeeSoft tool is also a good example of a visualisation of 1-dimensional data because it exhibits the use 
					of a folding axis.  A folding axis is an axis that is designed to use available space more efficiently by 
					folding back on its self at certain points (again, see Figure 8).  It is a 2-d method for visualising 1-d 
					data and therefore can be considered as a ‘dimension expansion’ technique. This technique can be applied to 
					the visualisation of data of dimensionality d > 1, but it is most effective when variables of only one 
					dimension are to be depicted.
					</p>
					
					<div style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="images/folding axis.png" alt="" /><br>
					</div>
					<p class="figureCaption">
					Figure 8: An example of reduced representation. The figure depicts two source code modules, each of which is on a folding axis.
					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<h3>2-dimensional visualisation</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					When dealing with data of two dimensions, the visualisation process is often based upon a 
					simple direct mapping onto two axes.  The most common form of a 2-dimensional visualisation is a geographical 
					map where locations are placed according to the longitude and latitude variables.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Data that are comprised of two-variable entities are described as planar.  This is because they map directly 
					onto a flat 2-dimensional surface or plane.  However, an interesting twist in the display of a 2-dimensional 
					layout was proposed in [<a href="#MRC91">MRC91</a>] where a ‘perspective wall’, shown in Figure 9, is described to transform 2-d 
					layouts into a 3-d representation. The basic idea is that 2-d layouts with large aspect ratios can be distorted 
					so that the central part of the layout is entirely visible to the user while the far left and right portions 
					appear to stretch off into the distance. This is a technique inspired by the bifocal lens [<a href="#SA82">SA82</a>, <a href="#ATS82">ATS82</a>]. This 
					serves the purpose of affording the user detail and overview simultaneously and is closely related to the 
					ideas of Furnas [<a href="#Fur86">Fur86</a>]. The perspective wall is also an example of a type of folding axis in the 2-d case, 
					where the two dimensions of the plane are folded in the direction of the third dimension (away from the user).

					<h3>3-dimensional visualisation</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					3-dimensional visualisation is most prominent in the field of scientific visualisation where collective 
					bodies of 3-d physical data are often the basis of analysis.  When a physical object is modelled it is useful 
					to render it in three dimensions to conform to the mental model of the person who is viewing it.  Examples 
					include the visualisation of molecular structures and the physiology of the human body.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Although 3-dimensional abstract data can be directly mapped into a 3-dimensional visualisation space, for 
					example a 3-d bar chart could be used to depict a company’s profit for different products across various cities, 
					abstract data often gains little from this embellishment.  This may be because there is no inherent physical 
					mental model to sustain. On the other hand, there have been attempts to use a 3-dimensional space to navigate 
					complex data structures.  In [<a href="#HK97">HK97</a>], a system called Cat-a-Cone consists of a hierarchical ConeTree [<a href="#RMC91">RMC91</a>] 
					which is displayed in three dimensions to make better use of screen real estate (see Figure 10). In [<a href="#Ren94">Ren94</a>] 
					a tool named Galaxy of News organises textual information in a 3-d space where similarity between texts is 
					reflected by their proximity to one another. As the user navigates through the space semantic zooming is employed 
					to show or elide text and detail, depending upon the user’s position in the space.  However, there can be serious 
					disadvantages to rendering abstract data in three dimensions.  A problem exhibited by the Cat-a-Cone system is 
					that the nodes of the tree can become occluded and therefore the amount of information to be gleaned at any one 
					time is reduced.  Also, in the Galaxy of News system, the lack of a referential horizon and ground plane can 
					cause the user to be disoriented.  In the words of Chalmers [<a href="#Cha93">Cha93</a>], “Our skills in…mental model-making, as honed 
					on our everyday ‘2.1D’ world, become more difficult to employ.”  In the context of this quote, Chalmers describes 
					a metaphor of a 2.1-d landscape for representing the distribution of a corpus of documents.  This type of 
					visualisation can be called an information landscape or themescape [<a href="#WTP*95">WTP*95</a>] and is based upon the premise that 
					the metaphor can provide landmarks and other natural aids to allow the user to build a mental map of the corpus. 
					Figure 11 depicts a visualisation based upon Wise’s themescape [<a href="#WTP*95">WTP*95</a>].

					Figure 10: Cat-a-Cone [<a href="#HK97">HK97</a>] arranges each level of a hierarchical categorisation scheme in a 3-d view to

					the focus (the node closest to the viewer) while maintaining the context of the adjacent nodes.

					Although 3-dimensional visualisations can be impressive, they do, in general, create cumbersome overheads.  
					They require more powerful hardware and require more intensive processing in the visual transformations; 
					navigation is more complex because at least six degrees of freedom of movement may be required and it is 
					more difficult to incorporate textual objects that are often predominant in information visualisation [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>].

					<h3>4+ -dimensional visualisation</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					In statistical analysis, data sets that are comprised of objects consisting of more than three variables are 
					described as multivariate or hypervariate and are considered as n-attribute items dispersed within an n-dimensional 
					space. Thus, in information visualisation these generally come under the rubric of the multidimensional. There has 
					been a great deal of work concentrating on the visualisation of multidimensional data, spurred on by the fact that 
					there is no possible way of directly mapping multidimensional objects onto a set of visually perceptive axes.  
					However, there are some shortcuts available to multidimensional data at the lower end of the scale.  For example, 
					three dimensions of 4-dimensional data may be mapped onto points in a 3-d substrate and the fourth dimension mapped 
					to colour, or shape, but beyond this, more innovative techniques must be derived.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Spoerri [<a href="#Spo93">Spo93</a>] proposes a tool called InfoCrystal (Figure 12) for querying and visualising results for 
					information retrieval. The idea is to generalise the Venn diagram to discretely display the distribution of objects 
					of more than three dimensions. This system is intuitive because of the familiarity with the Venn diagram; however, 
					as the number of dimensions to be depicted increases the complexity of the graphics soon becomes overwhelming.
					</p>

					respective queries to a document collection. In this example, these inputs define a 3-d search space, however, 
					Spoerri has demonstrated the application of InfoCrystals to more than three inputs.
					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Tweedie et al. [<a href="#TSDS96">TSDS96</a>] present the ‘Prosection Matrix’. This idea stems from the statistical technique of 
					representing all possible combinations of pairs of variables for a data set as a matrix of scatterplots.  
					They embellished this technique by adding an interaction technique called brushing [<a href="#BC87">BC87</a>] that allows selected 
					points in one scatterplot to be highlighted in others. In this case the brushing entails using sliders (one for 
					each dimension/parameter) to define selected parameter ranges so that points in one scatterplot, depicting the 
					relationship between p1 and p2 for instance, can be highlighted according to the selected range of p3 for example.  
					Hence the name prosection was derived from projection of a section. This technique, like that in InfoCrystal, also 
					becomes intractable for visualising data of many dimensions because the number of scatterplots required is equal 
					to N(N – 1)/2 where N is the number of dimensions.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					As the dimensionality of data increases, the plausible techniques for clearly depicting the influence of all of 
					the attributes falls sharply in number and in effectiveness.  It is partly for this reason that methods such as 
					Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Principal Components Analysis and a plethora of clustering algorithms exist. 
					Specifically, in information visualisation, their role is to map the objects from their high-dimensional space to 
					points in two or three dimensions.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Lin et al. [<a href="#LRP95">LSM91</a>] take advantage of Kohonen’s self-organising feature map (SOM) [<a href="#KKL*00">KKL*00</a>], to map high-dimensional 
					textual documents onto a discrete 2-d grid. As stated earlier, a corpus of textual documents has dimensionality 
					roughly equal to the number of unique terms contained within, and therefore it is impossible to directly map the 
					documents as points in this high-dimensional space into two or three dimensions.  Lin et al. proposed that the SOM 
					could be used to create concept areas in the plane of the SOM which would effectively partition the corpus into 
					classes and thus give insight into the topology of the corpus at a glance (see Figure 13).
					</p>

					Figure 13: An example of the output of a SOM, depicting the concept areas relating to electronics.
					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					The only drawback with this approach is that only the topology of the corpus is communicated.  Relationships 
					between individual documents cannot be visualised as only the cluster centres are depicted and the discrete 
					grid-like output of the SOM ensures that these are all evenly spaced.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					In a paper by Rodden et al. [<a href="#RBSW01">RBSW01</a>], another discrete visualisation maps images onto a grid to aid in browsing.  
					In this case an unspecified MDS algorithm is used to create a continuous 2-d layout of objects so that similar images 
					are placed close together, and then one of several algorithms proposed by Basalj [<a href="#Bas00">Bas00</a>] is utilised to discretise 
					the space in order to remove occlusions. This approach may be considered as an alternative heuristic to the SOM.
					</p>
					
					<br><br>
					
					<h2>Interactivity</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					It is difficult to communicate the intrinsic and latent relationships within high-dimensional abstract data through 
					a single static representation.  For this reason, mechanisms which afford the user interactive control over the 
					representation are required to unlock the information that can only be revealed in dynamic visualisations.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Affordance and appropriation</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					An important aspect that blends interactive visualisation with the premise of good graphical user interface (GUI) 
					design is the issue of affordance.  Affordance may be defined as the ability for an object to be perceived by the 
					user as usable according to his or her physical and mental abilities.  The user quickly understands the use of a 
					device for a given function or activity.  When affordance exists in the design of an interface, whether it is 
					physical or in the digital domain, the resulting system is easier and maybe even pleasant to use [<a href="#Nor88">Nor88</a>].  
					Sometimes affordances can be accidental, in which case the user may appropriate the functions to his or her own 
					ends in different ways to those the interface designer intended or even considered.  From the perspective of 
					interface evaluation via observation of use, this can be advantageous in offering insight into the correct way 
					to implement complex functions.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Time</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Another important consideration in the design of interactive systems is the speed of interaction.  In [<a href="#CRM91">CRM91</a>] 
					three categories of interaction speed are described:
					</p>
					
					<br><br>

					Table 3: Categories of interaction speeds.
					</p>
					
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Inspired by the interaction between humans, Robertson et al. [<a href="#RCM89">RCM89</a>], proposed an interface architecture called 
					the cognitive coprocessor to match the impedance between the user and an automated information agent. Essentially, 
					the response times of the system should match the capabilities and expectations of the user when reacting to 
					stimuli and carrying out elemental tasks.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Shneiderman [<a href="#Shn83">Shn83</a>] describes Direct Manipulation, which shows that a short response time for visual 
					feedback is very important. Direct manipulation can be described as a metaphor for manipulating 
					graphical objects as if using one’s own hands, in order to conform to the user’s expectations of what 
					should happen.  For example, when a file is dragged over the recycle bin on a Windows OS desktop, and 
					then let go, the file disappears as if the file has fallen into the bin. 	 Shneiderman also describes 
					the supplanting of textual query languages (in the user interface) such as SQL with direct manipulation 
					in the form of Dynamic Queries [<a href="#Shn94">Shn94</a>].  Dynamic queries provide immediate feedback during query formulation 
					by updating results as the queries are built.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					From the above, it can be considered that direct manipulation mechanisms must react to the user’s actions 
					within 0.1 seconds for the perceived continuity of physical motion.
					</p>
					
					<h3>Interaction mechanisms</h3>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					In a paper by Shneiderman [<a href="#Shn96">Shn96</a>], his visual information seeking mantra is described: “Overview first, 
					zoom and filter, then details-on-demand”. According to Shneiderman this indicates the basic elements required 
					in an interactive visualisation when seeking information.  However, this implies that visual information 
					seeking is a sequential process where a series of views are presented in isolation. The following sub-sections 
					describe interaction mechanisms that have been developed to integrate such views so that overview and 
					detail can be presented simultaneously, and zooming and filtering can be applied within the context of the 
					original view.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Overview plus detail</h4>
					
					<p class="text">
					An overview of a visual representation is important to afford the user navigation and pattern detection.  
					As a result, searching can be enhanced.  However, both the whole overview and the finer-grained details of 
					local data structures are often required to facilitate analysis and evaluation of smaller portions of data.  
					The overview enables a high-level view to help orient the user while (s)he drills down into the details.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					A typical guise of overview plus detail is the zoom function.  In Eick’s SeeSoft tool [<a href="#Eic94a">Eic94a</a>], a separate 
					window can be shown over the reduced representation in order to allow the user to read individual lines of code. 
					The advantage of this is that the user may perceive where he or she is within the overview and also gain finer details of that 
					area.  This, applied in SeeSoft, is an example of focus plus context and mimics the human’s visual system where the 
					bandwidth is split between the peripheral view and the higher resolution focus [<a href="#CMS99">CMS99</a>]. This allows people to understand 
					something by its context as well as its detail within the context.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Two everyday examples of overview + detail include Windows Explorer – the overview is provided by a treeview 
					while the detail is shown as a set of file and folder icons in a separate pane – and Adobe Acrobat [<a href="#Ado04">Ado04</a>] where 
					the thumbnail view gives a (reduced representation) overview of a PDF file, next to the detailed text.  North, 
					Shneiderman and Plaisant [<a href="#NSP96">NSP96</a>] contributed a more novel application in the visualisation of a medical digital library. 
					The overview is a longitudinal cut of a human body and the detail view consists of an axial cross-section (see Figure 14).
					</p>
					
					<div style="text-align:center;">
						<img src="images/OverviewDetail.bmp" alt="" /><br>
					</div>
					<p class="figureCaption">
					Figure 14: North et al.’s Visible Human Explorer interface. The overview of the human body is tightly coupled 
					with axial detail view. The user can sweep a horizontal line across the overview to dynamically update the 
					detailed cross-section view.
					</p>
					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					The following subsection is inspired by the problem of overview plus detail and describes some of the methods for achieving it.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Focus plus context</h4>
					
					<p class="text">
					Focus plus context is related to overview plus detail by the fact that the context is provided by the overview and 
					the focus is on the finer detail.  A classic example of the focus plus context method is Furnas’s Generalised 
					Fisheye Views [<a href="#Fur86">Fur86</a>].  In this paper, Furnas defines a degree of interest (DOI) function that is used to assign 
					a number reflecting the importance to the user of an object within a visual structure, given his or her current 
					task.  This number can then be used to reduce or remove detail from less important areas of the view.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					This is an example of a distortion technique similar to the Perspective Wall [<a href="#MRC91">MRC91</a>].  Another example of 
					view distortion for focus plus context is the hyperbolic tree [<a href="#LRP95">LRP95</a>], where it is proposed that by mapping 
					large hierarchical trees onto a hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic geometry will create a fisheye-like distortion.  
					The part of the plane that is the least distorted (more detailed and larger) is that which is closest to the 
					viewpoint in the centre of the screen, i.e. the focus, whereas other areas are more distorted and shrink the 
					embedded objects as the distance from the focus increases. Direct manipulation is used here to rotate the 
					hyperbolic plane and thus move the focus, and as a result very large tree hierarchies may be displayed.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Zooming is another well established technique for gaining insight into detailed areas of a view while 
					maintaining the context.  There are two predominant types of zoom mechanisms: semantic and logical.  
					Logical zooming lends itself more to our familiar notion of zooming as it describes the perspective 
					notion of objects being larger when closer and smaller as the distance between them and the viewer 
					increases. For this reason, logical zooming can be described as physical or geometric because our 
					psychophysical perspective pertains mainly to changes in object size and colour saturation for this 
					type of zooming. The SeeSoft tool described above makes use of logical zooming.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					On the other hand, semantic zooming, which may or may not contain aspects of logical zooming, pertains 
					more to the idea that as the area of focus approaches objects, the level of abstraction is changed – 
					mappings of data attributes to graphical properties change.  A user-interface proposed by Bederson and 
					Hollan called Pad++ [<a href="#BH94">BH94</a>] provides semantic zooming.  Here, direct manipulation of a focus point is 
					used to provide additional details to objects that appear under the focus.  The Magic Lens [<a href="#FS95">FS95</a>] is 
					another example of the zooming paradigm and has been demonstrated as a way to supplant textual database 
					querying because multiple lenses (focus points) can be used in conjunction to form Boolean expressions 
					that filter or abstract details of the objects being visualised.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					This now leads on to describing filtering within an information space.  As stated earlier it is difficult 
					to map high dimensional abstract data into a single static view.  As a result MDS techniques have been 
					devised to reduce the dimensionality in order to be able to display high-dimensional objects in a 2- or 
					3-d point space, usually preserving some distance function.  Although this provides an overview of the 
					data set’s distribution, the contribution of individual attributes can be hard to interpret in these 
					scatterplot-like displays – some variables may be more dominant than others.  It is for this reason 
					that filtering comes into its own as a means for drilling down into the data to help find latent 
					relationships.  As described, the magic lens is one means but there are many other GUI components 
					that may afford the filtering process.  One such component is the slider control, which provides an 
					example of direct manipulation for view transformation.  In [<a href="#CM97">CM97</a>] it is stated that using sliders, 
					a user can take into account additional variables without these being mapped to retinal properties.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					In essence, a slider is a GUI control that allows the user to define ranges (double-ended sliders) or to 
					select individual values or thresholds.  Eick [<a href="#Eic94b">Eic94b</a>] describes the use of sliders to filter or highlight 
					items within a view as determined by the value or range of values selected by the slider.  An example of 
					which can be found in Ahlberg and Shneiderman’s filmfinder [<a href="#AS94a">AS94a</a>] as shown in Figure 15.  In filmfinder, 
					the range selected in a double-ended slider maps to a zoom function, while the position of the range, along 
					the slider’s scale, maps to a pan function.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Eick then goes on to describe graphical embellishments such as using the space inside the slider to 
					depict the distribution of the data being analysed (see Figure 16) and thereby provide clues in 
					information seeking.
					</p>

					to zoom and pan along the two axes, essentially filtering the view.

					<br><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					Tweedie et al. [<a href="#TSDS96">TSDS96</a>] also make use of this type of enhanced slider.  In their influence 
					explorer tool, where histograms are used in conjunction with sliders, the sliders are all 
					interlinked so that when the selection of one slider is changed, the effect can be seen by 
					highlighting sections of the histograms of other sliders.
					</p>

					<h2>Conclusions</h2>&nbsp;<a href="#toc" class="backTop">back to top</a><br><br>
					
					<p class="text">
					In this page some of the techniques used in information visualisation, and their motivations, 
					have been described. Information visualisation serves as a key to unlock the black box of abstract 
					data, to reveal the interrelationships and salient properties. It is holistic in nature – it is 
					more than just a collection of glyphs, axes and graphical structures. Through abstraction, 
					visualisation can help the user create mental models of the data and gain insight into their 
					structure. Through interaction, the user is prompted to ask questions and then be provided 
					with the answers.  It can afford the user navigation and browsing of abstract data whose 
					elements reside in a bewildering number of dimensions. 	 It is envisaged that in the future 
					many more interesting and novel devices will be devised to aid the user’s perception of 
					complex data and their interrelationships.
					</p>
					
					<p class="text">
					Visualisation relies upon intuitive reduction of data so that their representation is simplified 
					and therefore information is easier to convey. A very popular means of attaining this is via cluster 
					analysis. By considering data as points in a data space, clustering algorithms can find contiguous 
					groups of closely related points thus reducing the representative size of the data set to the number 
					of clusters. Another approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the data so that it conveys as 
					much of the original information as possible using a small number of derived dimensions. 
					Clustering and dimension reduction algorithms often go hand-in-hand to 
					create hybrid solutions that provide an efficient and effective basis for visualisation.
